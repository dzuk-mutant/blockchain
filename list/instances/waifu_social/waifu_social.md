(yes, that's the instance name, idk what's with these people)

This is a French instance that I was tipped off on. Here are some posts and translations of those posts. My fluent french-speaking sources tell me there's a lot more where this came from, and given what the admin says, it's not hard to imagine.

Feminists are paired with condoms (???? i don't even), LGBT is placed next to 'basic biology' (ie. the bizarre false, right-wing idea that somehow the existence of LGBT defies basic human biology).

From an instance admin: "we're not alt-right, we're just sick of SJWs and LGBTs"

And if you look at the pleroma instance they just set up, [it won't take long for you to find that the admin is quite open with the idea of spouting racial slurs](../lolis_world/lolis_world.md).
