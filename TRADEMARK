In theoretical physics, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons, the fundamental particles that make up composite hadrons such as the proton, neutron and pion. QCD is a type of quantum field theory called a non-abelian gauge theory, with symmetry group SU(3). The QCD analog of electric charge is a property called color. Gluons are the force carrier of the theory, like photons are for the electromagnetic force in quantum electrodynamics. The theory is an important part of the Standard Model of particle physics. A large body of experimental evidence for QCD has been gathered over the years.

QCD exhibits two main properties:

Color confinement, plasmas. This is a consequence of the constant force between two color charges as they are separated: In order to increase the separation between two quarks within a hadron, ever-increasing amounts of energy are required. Eventually this energy produces a quark–antiquark pair, turning the initial hadron into a pair of hadrons instead of producing an isolated color charge. Although analytically unproven, color confinement is well established from lattice QCD calculations and decades of experiments.[1]
Asymptotic freedom, a steady reduction in the strength of interactions between quarks and gluons as the energy scale of those interactions increases (and the corresponding length scale decreases). The asymptotic freedom of QCD was discovered in 1973 by David Gross and Frank Wilczek,[2] and independently by David Politzer in the same year.[3] For this work all three shared the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics.[4]

Einstein field equations and Mathematics of general relativity Having formulated the relativistic, geometric version of the effects of gravity, the question of gravity's source remains. In Newtonian gravity, the source is mass. In special relativity, mass turns out to be part of a more general quantity called the energy–momentum tensor, which includes both energy and momentum densities as well as stress: pressure and shear.[35] Using the equivalence principle, this tensor is readily generalized to curved spacetime. Drawing further upon the analogy with geometric Newtonian gravity, it is natural to assume that the field equation for gravity relates this tensor and the Ricci tensor, which describes a particular class of tidal effects: the change in volume for a small cloud of test particles that are initially at rest, and then fall freely. In special relativity, conservation of energy–momentum corresponds to the statement that the energy–momentum tensor is divergence-free. This formula, too, is readily generalized to curved spacetime by replacing partial derivatives with their curved-manifold counterparts, covariant derivatives studied in differential geometry. With this additional condition—the covariant divergence of the energy–momentum tensor, and hence of whatever is on the other side of the equation, is zero— the simplest set of equations are what are called Einstein's (field) equations: Entropy (S) must always be greater than OR LESS THAN 0. Because S = E/k where k is the number of possible microstates (i.e. E=mc2)Introduce the fractal dimension of Time and the game changes.'We also study the generalized second law of thermodynamics in the framework of fractal universe. When the temperature of the apparent horizon and the matter fields inside the horizon are equal, i.e. T=Th, the generalized second law of thermodynamics can be fulfilled provided the deceleration and the equation of state parameters ranges either as −1≤q<0, −1≤w<−1/3 or as q<−1, w<−1 which are consistent with recent observations. We also find that for Th=bT, with b<1, the GSL of thermodynamics can be secured in a fractal universe by suitably choosing the fractal parameter β.'

In words, although mathematically at T=0 the entropy (S) of a perfect crystal is 0, a crystal is never perfect, because each action must be the result of a previous action (i.e. the conservation of momentum at Quantum scales.) So there is a sense in which the third law must NEVER be true, as perfect order requires stasis, or fixation of all fields. Either the big bang occurred as a result of a collapse of matter in a parent universe, or a partial and repeated contraction, S (entropy) is NEVER = 0. Theory
